//! **An undo-redo library.**
//!
//! It is an implementation of the action pattern, where all modifications are done
//! by creating objects of actions that applies the modifications. All actions knows
//! how to undo the changes it applies, and by using the provided data structures
//! it is easy to apply, undo, and redo changes made to a target.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * [`Action`] provides the base functionality for all actions. Multiple [`Action`]s can be merged into a single action
//!   by implementing the [`merge`](Action::merge) method on the action. This allows smaller actions to be used to build
//!   more complex operations, or smaller incremental changes to be merged into larger changes that can be undone and
//!   redone in a single step.
//!
//! * [`Record`] provides basic undo-redo functionality.
//! * [`History`] provides non-linear undo-redo functionality that allows you to jump between different branches.
//!
//! * `Queues` that wraps a record or history and extends them with queue functionality.
//! * `Checkpoints` that wraps a record or history and extends them with checkpoint functionality.
//! * The target can be marked as being saved to disk and the data-structures can track the saved state and notify
//!   when it changes.
//! * The amount of changes being tracked can be configured by the user so only the `N` most recent changes are stored.
//! * Configurable display formatting using the display structure.
